properties:
    spi-max-frequency:
      type: int
      required: true

    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array

        The INT signal default configuration is active-high.  The
        property value should ensure the flags properly describe the
        signal that is presented to the driver.

      type: boolean
      required: true
      description: |
        Set to indicate phase starts with asserted half-phase (CPHA=1).
        For this driver using this property requires also using cpol.

      type: boolean
      required: true
      description: |
        Set to indicate clock leading edge is falling (CPOL=1).
